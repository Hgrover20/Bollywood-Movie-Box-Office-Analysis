## üìä Summary of Analysis and Insights

### Dataset Description

The dataset `bollywood.csv` includes:

* Movie names, genres, and star cast information.
* Box office collections (Opening, Weekend, and Lifetime Gross).
* Social media promotion metrics (YouTube Likes/Dislikes, Twitter data, etc.).

### Data Preparation Steps

* Handled missing values by imputing zeroes where appropriate (e.g., missing YouTube dislikes).
* Removed duplicate records.
* Checked for null values and ensured dataset integrity before analysis.

### Key Insights

* **Insight #1**: Movies with higher YouTube likes generally had better lifetime collections, suggesting that social media buzz correlates with success.
* **Insight #2**: Action and drama genres dominated both in number and average revenue generated.
* **Insight #3**: There is a positive correlation between opening week collections and lifetime collections, indicating that initial performance is a strong predictor of overall success.
* **Insight #4**: Movies with well-known star casts tend to receive more engagement on social media, but this does not always translate to box office success.
* **Insight #5**: Some movies with low YouTube dislikes and high likes underperformed, indicating that social media metrics alone are not foolproof indicators of success.
